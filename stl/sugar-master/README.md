Modular web framework for Elixir

## 0.4.x -> 0.5.x Upgrade Warning

Please note that `ecto` and `postgrex` have been removed from Sugar's dependencies as of version 0.5.0.  If your application uses Ecto, you'll need to add it to your application's `mix.exs`, like so:

```elixir
def project do
  [ app: :my_app,
  # ...
    deps: deps() ]
end

def deps do
  [ {:sugar, "~> 0.5.0"},
    {:ecto, "~> 2.1"},
    {:postgrex, "~> 0.13.0"} ]
end
```

## Goals

- Speed. Sugar shouldn't be slow and neither should your project.
- Ease. Sugar should be simple because simple is easy to learn, use and maintain.
- Effective. Sugar should aid development. You have better things to which to devote your time.

## Reason for Existence

Why build this when [Dynamo](https://github.com/dynamo/dynamo), [Weber](http://elixir-web.github.io/weber/), and [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) exist with growing communities? While these projects are great in their own right, Sugar aims to be another contender, sparking more development on all three projects (and/or others that may follow) and giving developers another option when deciding what framework fits their needs best. Sugar may even strive to shake things up just as [ChicagoBoss](http://www.chicagoboss.org/) has done.

## Getting Started

```
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/sugar-framework/simple.git
cd simple

# Get project dependencies
mix deps.get

# Start the web server
mix server # or `iex -S mix server` if you want access to iex
```

### Configurations

Sugar needs to be configured in your application's `config/config.exs` in order to work.  The following options are supported:

#### `config :sugar, router: MyWebsite.Router`

Tells Sugar which module to use as a router.  This module should implement `Sugar.Router`, and should have at least one route defined.  This is required.

#### `config :sugar, plug_adapter: Plug.Adapters.Cowboy`

Tells Sugar which web server to use to handle HTTP(S) requests.  Cowboy is currently the only supported option, and Sugar will default to using `Plug.Adapters.Cowboy` if this is omitted.

#### `config :sugar, MyWebsite.Router, ...`

Tells Sugar how the specified router should be configured.  The following options are supported:

- `http`: takes a key/value list with options to configure the specified `:plug_adapter`.  Of particular usefulness:
    - `ip`: IP address the server should bind to.  Should be a tuple in the format `{x,y,z,w}`.  Defaults to accepting connections on any IP address.
    - `port`: port the server should listen on.  Defaults to 4000.
    - `acceptors`: the number of acceptors for the listener.  Defaults to 100.
    - `max_connections`: the maximum number of connections supported.  Defaults to `:infinity`.
    - `compress`: whether or not the bodies of responses should be compressed.  Defaults to `false`.
- `https`: takes a key/value list with the same options as `http`, or can be set to `false` if you don't want to enable HTTPS.  The following additional options(along with others from Erlang's "ssl" module) are supported:
    - `password`: a plaintext, secret password for the private SSL key (if it's password-protected)
    - `keyfile`: path to the PEM-format private key file to use
    - `certfile`: path to the PEM-format certificate to use
    - `otp_app` - If present, `certfile` and `keyfile` can be relative paths with respect to `otp_app`'s `priv` directory.

> Note: Create a self-signed certificate for easy HTTPS testing.
>
> ```
> # Generate a keyfile
> $ openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
>
> # Create a CSR
> $ openssl req -new -key key.pem -out request.pem
>
> # Generate a certfile that expires in $NUM_DAYS
> $ openssl x509 -req -days $NUM_DAYS -in request.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
> ```

#### Example

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :sugar, router: MyWebsite.Router

config :sugar, MyWebsite.Router,
  http: [
    port: 80
  ],
  https: [
    port: 443,
    password: "OMG_SUPER_SECRET",
	keyfile: "/path/to/key.pem",
	certfile: "/path/to/cert.pem"
  ]
```

### Routers

Because Sugar builds upon [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug), it leverages `Plug.Router` to do the heavy lifting in routing your application, adding an alternate DSL.

Routes are defined with the form:

    method route [guard], controller, action

`method` is `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, or `options`, each responsible for a single HTTP method. `method` can also be `any`, which will match on all HTTP methods. `controller` is any valid Elixir module name, and `action` is any valid function defined in the `controller` module.

#### Example

```elixir
defmodule MyWebsite.Router do
  use Sugar.Router

  get "/", Hello, :index
  get "/pages/:id", Hello, :show
  post "/pages", Hello, :create
  put "/pages/:id" when id == 1, Hello, :show
end
```

### Controllers

All controller actions should have an arrity of 2, with the first argument being a `Plug.Conn` representing the current connection and the second argument being a `Keyword` list of any parameters captured in the route path.

Sugar bundles these response helpers to assist in sending a response:

- `render/2` - sends a normal response
- `not_found/1` - sends a 404 (Not found) response

#### Example

```elixir
defmodule MyWebsite.Controllers.Hello do
  use Sugar.Controller

  def index(conn, []) do
    render conn, "index.html.eex", []
  end

  def show(conn, args) do
    render conn, "show.html.eex", args
  end

  def create(conn, []) do
    render conn, "create.html.eex", []
  end
end
```
