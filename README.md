This is a Discord Bot I made along with an internal API (thats why its called YttriusAPI or yAPI)

`/core` is mainly used for one of the C libraries I use to parse JS.

This folder does not only include the bot, but also includes its API.

You can find this code [Not really updated] on other Git Providers here:

Any files within `./database` or `./db` are kept confidential unless details are meant to be shown to the public. 

Files / Directories in `./personal_packages` are to be deleted if said consumer will be utilizing this API. This package only contains packages I need for this API to be hosted on a development container, so use at your own risk!
